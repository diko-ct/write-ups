when you use any Monoalphabetic Substitution Decoder

you know that it is a pragraph talking about something so you try to search about this paragraph but the paragraph about what ??? 
it is about analysis the title frequency analysis  

![analysis2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75040566/190220490-af4314dd-a8fe-4a2c-8b23-1838bd658a34.png)

so now you know the original text 

```
The study of quantitatively describing the characteristics of a set of data is called descriptive statistics. Frequency Analysis is a part of descriptive statistics. In statistics, frequency is the number of times an event occurs. Frequency Analysis is an important area of statistics that deals with the number of occurrences (frequency) and analyzes measures of central tendency, dispersion, percentiles, etc.
```
but cipher is taller than original text 

you will know that . = % | , = _

so line2 there's a difference 

```
Frequency Analysis is a part of descriptive statistics. In statistics, frequency is the number of times an event

okgdlgocp aoaepoio io a fakf jo $ pjl gakogb if plcfn"nk2dl2scp<3s3epo8o( -bgockiffigg ofafiofico% io ofafiofico_ okgdlgocp io fpg olmpgk jo fimgo ao gggof jcclko%

```
as we know the flag is one sentence without spaces so you can take the sentence 
```
plcfn"nk2dl2scp<3s3epo8o(
```
so what should i do now ? 
i know some chars like yuctf ,  y=p  u=l ,c=c , t =f , f = n , " = { , ) = }  . _ = < 

hmmm did you notice something ??  the chars substituted with chars alone and puctuation alone so maybe digits alone

using a script or any website  you will get this 
```
yuctf{f;;;u;;cy_;;;;y;;;}
yuctf{fk2du2scy_3s3eyo8o}
```
did you notice that the first word is similar to   a word we mentioned earlier ? yes it's frequency so the second word is analysis. 
but i should now get the write nums 

then r = k  , 3=2 , q =d  , n = s , 4 = 3 , l = e  , s = o 1 =8

flag = yuctf{fr3qu3ncy_4n4lys1s}
